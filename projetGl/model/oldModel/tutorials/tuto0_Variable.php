<h2><a href="#">What are the variables?</a></h2>
In computer programming is a storage location in your computer with an associated <strong>symbolic name</strong> which contains a <strong>value</strong>. You can compare that to a box or a jar who have data inside and a tag on them. The data inside the jar can be from different types:
<br />
<ul>
    <li><strong>String</strong>: A string is a variable that contain alphanumeric characters and allowed symbols that are contained within quotation marks. For exemple, "Hello world in 2015!". A string could also be in single quote, '"Programming is wonderfull", teacher said.'. The single quote are really usefull when you need to use the double quote in the string. The string are generally use to store sentence or text.</li>
    <li><strong>Number</strong>: The number store all the numbers. And it's not need to use any quote to write it. So if you want to store the value 6, you just need to write it and it done.</li>
    <li><strong>Boolean</strong>: The boolean could take only two value: true or false. This kind of variable is really near a on and off switch. It's use to solve problem by asking question. For example 6 is bigger than 9, result is false.</li>
</ul>
<br />
Now you know the type of the variable you will need to know how to declare and init them. The world of programming give us many different <strong>language</strong> and also many differents way to do the same thing. But in our case we will stay focus and the <strong>Python</strong> and the <strong>pseudo-code</strong>. The python is a really common language use to programming. And the pseudo-code is use only to present something to some one else. The pseudo-code is ofenly use to discover programming. In our case we will show the both way to declare varibles (in python and also in pseudo code) For example:
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Python</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>String: myVariableString = "Hello"</li>
            <li>Number: myVariabmeNumber = 6</li>
            <li>Boolean: myVariableBoolean = true</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Pseudo-code</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>String: myVariableString <- Hello</li>
            <li>Number: myVariabmeNumber <- 6</li>
            <li>Boolean: myVariableBoolean <- true</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
The majority of the time the variable start with letter and contain only letters and numbers. When you need to use many word in the same variable you use the uppercase to separate the different words. Like in ou case: <strong>my variable string</strong> become <strong>myVariableString</strong>

In our system if you go the sandbox part for example. You can use the left part to declare a varible. To create a variable you just need to select the good element. A variable is represented by a <strong>white box</strong>. On this one you just need to add a <strong>name</strong> in the area (on the area is write "name the variable"). After selected a name you just need to <strong>drag and drop</strong> it on the screen (the white part).

Now you have your variable. This variable doesn't containt any <strong>value or any type</strong>. The type of the variables will be define during the first <strong>affectation</strong> of value. To do an affectation you need to select <strong>the circle</strong>. Under it you need to put a value. The value will be <strong>a number or a string or a boolean</strong>. After putting the value in the area where it's write "enter a value" you need to grad and drop the circle in the white box you symbolise the variable.
